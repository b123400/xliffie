@implementation NSTextView (CopyAttachment)

/// So I tried to make a nice editable text field...
/// The default one is nice except, when I add custom NSTextAttachement in it, it doesn't handle copy and paste well.
/// I tried to implement methods like this:
/// - (BOOL)textView: writeCell: atIndex: toPasteboard: type:
/// which is designed for copying attachment, but it is only triggered when I am copy only the attachment,
/// when I copy mixed text and attachment, it doesn't merge together.
/// A solution would be returning a custom field edior from the cell, so I tried.
/// With a custom NSTextView subclass overriding -writeSelectionToPasteboard: type:, I can compute my own text to copy so that's fine,
/// however returning a [NSTextView fieldEditor] or anything would result in a text view that's kind of different from the default one,
/// even when the fieldEditor = YES is set, like pressing Enter doesn't end editing and focus ring gone missing.
/// Since all I need is overriding the copy mechanism, I decided to swizzle the method, and it goes so well.
